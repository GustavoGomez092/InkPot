  "task_description": "# Emoji Font Rendering Fix\n\nResolve the emoji font rendering issues in React-PDF by implementing proper emoji fallback fonts or converting emojis to images during PDF generation. Ensure consistent emoji appearance across all platforms.\n\n## Rationale\nTechnical debt item from discovery. Notion explicitly has issues with custom emojis not appearing in PDF exports (pain-5-3). Professional documents increasingly use emojis for visual communication, and broken rendering undermines document quality.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a content creator, I want emojis in my documents to export correctly to PDF so that my documents look professional\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Standard Unicode emojis render correctly in PDF export\n- [ ] Emoji appearance is consistent between editor and PDF output\n- [ ] No missing glyph boxes or substituted characters for emojis\n- [ ] Solution works across macOS, Windows, and Linux\n- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (<100ms additional processing for typical document)\n",
